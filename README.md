# Hi im Kenzie, 
I’m a person who takes pride in being open to watching many things, but my favourite genre is anime and manga. I also enjoy watching sports – mostly the NBA – and spent most of my quarantine catching up to my neverending planning to watch list. I hope we get along this semester :)

BTW, the numbers represent the order I completed the work in each category.
