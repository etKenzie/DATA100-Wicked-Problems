## Advancement of Big Data
With the widespread technological advances such as the internet worldwide, there has been more data coming in than ever before. From learning what parts of your website users interact with the most, to straightforward social media posts: data is abundant. Because big data has been growing there has been a need to advance the ways in which we measure and analyse data. Keeping in mind that much of the data being created is the result of a different activity, what has allowed data scientist to further interpret this data is the advancement of computational and analytical techniques. These include things such as artificial intelligence, which aim to detect patterns and create predictive models. Through interpreting the information gained from these developments there is much to be gained.

The advancement in measurement is not something new. From Youtube video recommendation to simply random advertisements we get online while scrolling through the web, all these things are the result of corporations understanding their consumer base through the data they collect as we nonchalantly browse the web. This has paved the way for what Kitchen names as “data-borne” insights, which will change the way that “knowledge is produced, business conducted, and governance enacted”. This connects well with his next point that it allows for new research across many disciplines. Fashion designers, photographers, and website creators use data to see if they are effectively reaching their target audience, while scientists can use data to conduct less biased and more comprehensive experiments. Kitchen notes that the fourth paradigm of science is one where there will be a data-intensive exploration instead of more deductive based approaches. No matter what discipline that people get into in the future there will always be a place where data can be used, as regardless of your job understanding and making use of human behaviour will always be helpful.

The interesting thing though is that despite all the advancements in technology, there will always be a place for human involvement. Without interpreting data, there can never be anything fruitful to come of the ever-growing data. As humans continue to develop, there will always be a noticeable change in the data we produce. The processing of this continuously changing data that allows for humans to understand widespread change among us.
