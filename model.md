## FIRST TRY
Now that I've finished the other projects I needed to select an AMD to dive deeper into and initially I chose Na'oor. These are thee initial parts of the project where I breifly show the population in the map.

## Swithching It Up
After going deeper into the process here I found that the area of this ADM2 was to smalll and thus I could not do a good job in modeling it. So I decided to switch things up and changed the area I chose to dive deeper into. In the end, I combined two ADM2's that was not too populated but had bigger areas. 

This is the area I selected on a map of Jordan

Then after I did the same entire process I got the density plot

Then I seperated the areas to see which parts were more urbanized.

At this point I added different important parts such as the Roads. Here the red is primary roads, orange is secondary roads, and grey is more secluded roads.

Then showing the healthcare. Here the red is hospitals and clinics, while the blue is other types of healthcare arounud the area

Here you can notice that within the two ADM2's that I was focusing on there really weren't any healthcare facilities. Instead all of them resided in the ADM2 beside it, which is Amman, which is actually a lot more populated and is part of the capital of Jordan. This goes to show that if you lived in the part of the country where I was plotting, then you would need to head to the capital city to get treated. Which shows the lack of healthcare in underurbanized areas.
