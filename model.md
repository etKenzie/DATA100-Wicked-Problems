## FIRST TRY
Now that I've finished the other projects I needed to select an AMD to dive deeper into and initially I chose Na'oor. These are thee initial parts of the project where I breifly show the population in the map.

## Switching It Up
After going deeper into the process here I found that the area of this ADM2 was to smalll and thus I could not do a good job in modeling it. So I decided to switch things up and changed the area I chose to dive deeper into. In the end, I combined two ADM2's that was not too populated but had bigger areas. 

This is the area I selected on a map of Jordan

Then after I did the same entire process I got the density plot

Then I seperated the areas to see which parts were more urbanized.

At this point I added different important parts such as the Roads. Here the red is primary roads, orange is secondary roads, and grey is more secluded roads.

As seen here most of the main roads dont go into the area I selected. Most of it is just at the outskirts, and this proves how the area I've selected it actually a secluded area, which is why not a lot of people live or go to these areas. This explains why the population is low even considering that its size is pretty big.

Then showing the healthcare. Here the red is hospitals and clinics, while the blue is other types of healthcare around the area

Here you can notice that within the two ADM2's that I was focusing on there really weren't any healthcare facilities. Instead all of them resided in the ADM2 beside it, which is Amman, which is actually a lot more populated and is part of the capital of Jordan. This goes to show that if you lived in the part of the country where I was plotting, then you would need to head to the capital city to get treated. Which shows the lack of healthcare in underurbanized areas.  

## 3D Modelling 
Now at this point I only need to do a 3d Model of my area along with all the info I added before.

First I got a topography of the entire area

Then I made an outline of my combined ADM2's and placed it into the model

![](6(11).PNG)

Lastly, I added all the information in the graphs on the previous part
![](6(12).PNG)

Honestly this topography explains quite a lot about my area. It shows prety much why there isn't too much urban areas in my region as there are mountains and a huge downward slope that makes it harder to build around this area. This is probably why even though this is such a huge area there aren't to many people living in it.

ROADS

Regarding the roads in this area I can see why there are so little in my selected region. Considering how mountanous it is there must be a lot of difficulty in finding places where they could build roads. Also, there are secondary roads that go between alot of mountains which would be the only way to traverse this area. The topography explains a lot about why there is so little roads along this area. 

HEALTH

The healthcare facilities in the topography image is mainlly on the highground where there are many roads and as stated in before, is part of the capital of Jordan, Amman. The mountains being all around goes to show how dangerous these areas are. It must be difficult to build within these areas, which is why in my selected region you can't really find any healthcare facilities. But this brings an issue, because these people who live in this area need more healthcare facilities. They need to be able to treated where they are instead of needing to go all the way to the capital. Honestly, I think this area is still underdeveloped considering the lack of healthcare, especially considering it is mainly in mountain areas where things are more dangerous. This area needs to develop. 

All in all producing this three dimensional map has helped me better understnad the area, and why it is not so popular. It does not result in a different interpretation but rather it gives more insight. The lack of roads is understandable as the mountanous areas make it more difficult, but it's pretty clear that this area need to have more healthcare facilities.
