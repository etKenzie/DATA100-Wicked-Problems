Provide three examples from Geoff West’s reading that illustrate how scale can be used to more fully understand human development as a complex and adapting social and economic system.  Additionally, what did Geoff West have to say about the use of theory and big data?  According to West, can a theory be relevant in the face of big data?  Provide an example.
From West’s first two chapters I think the questions he asks in the first chapter partially shows how we can develop as a social and economic system is from the questions. Through these questions such as “why can we live for up to 120 years but not for a thousand or a million” and “why do we stop growing”, we get a better understanding of ourselves and how we work as a species. The first chapter’s strongest point is that data can be used to understand things that we could never have before. Asking these big questions requires interdisciplinary work as he highlights which is why data science is so vast and not limited to one subject. 
Some examples he uses to show how scale is with his contrast in animals. From things as small as bacteria to mammals as huge as blue whales, there are aspects that we can camper them based on. In all that complexity and randomness there are commonalities we can see that allows us to compare things. With animals he uses the number of heart beats in an animal’s lifetime compared to their weight. And despite living such a vastly different number of years these animals have roughly the same number of heartbeats. Seeing a trend like this helps us understand better how these animals relate and from that we understand them better. Another example with animals is the metabolic rate plotted against their body mass. Doing this lets us see a linear trend, which once again allows us to better understand animals in relation to one another. More directly related to human life is his next plot of patients against population, and from these we see a linear relationship between the two, which allows us to predict how much hospitals we need just from knowing out population. And lastly is thee plot of income and assets against its employees, which show trends that allows companies to see have some idea of how they’ll grow. Basically, the idea is that within all this randomness, there is always an aspect that we can explore to understand trends. The randomness of human development can be better understood with the use of scale. 
Next in the second chapter he highlights how cities and global urbanization is an important part in our planet’s future. And especially important within that is big data. Cities are complex. They have many facets to them and they have many great parts such as public health, water availability, financial markets, etc. But with that comes many challenges, and what allows for us to overcome them is big data. The ability to understand and conceptualize a cities dynamism, growth, and evolution, is required for a city to become sustainable. This is the importance of big data and theorizing when working together. We use big data to make predictions, such as how we currently see such a strong trend in the urbanization of the world. West predicts that by 2050, 75% of the world will be in cities. Theories and trends such as these allows us to be prepared. A theory now is no longer good without data in support of it. Trends help explain and predict life. Theories should be tested out with big data.
