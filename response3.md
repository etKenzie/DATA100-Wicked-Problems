**How does Owen Barder define development? How does he extend Amartya Sen’s definition to include the idea of complexity?**

Development is to Barder is not an individual thing. He defines it as “a characteristic of the economic social and political system”. As he says the economy is made of many moving parts. Being the people, products, firms and institutions. This means it behaves as a system between these parts and therefore focusing on one aspect in itself does not lead to development. He points out the term, “self-organizing complexity”. Sen’s definition was mainly on improving the life of individuals. Giving individuals more choice, quality of life, and freedom. This judge’s development based on the effect on individuals, where in reality there is more to it. Just because the incomes of people in two different countries are the same doesn’t equal the same level of development. 
It should try to harness the strength of adaptation and complexity, embraces experimentation, look for ways to nurture the adaptation and evolution which brings change that accelerates and shapes evolution


**Question #2. What was the toaster project? What did Thomas Thwaites attempt to do? Was he successful? What is the significance of this example in the context of complexity?**

The toaster project was Thwaites’s attempt to show how something as simple as a 3-dollar toaster required many moving parts, and thus illustrate how the development worked. He tried to create his own toaster be individually creating every single part, but as a result not only did, he spend a significant more amount of money in creating it, he wasn’t successful. If someone was able to make a business of selling toasters it takes more than just the parts. There would need distribution, maintaining workers, etc. This showed that development wasn’t only an increase of output of a single firm, but the improvement of a system of institutions, that led to making peoples lives better. 

**Question #3.  According to Barder how successful have economic models been at describing and predicting growth over the past 50 years?**

Essentially, he argues that economic models have not been able to successfully describe and predict growth. The Harod Domar growth model focused to much on the capital and labour. Walter Rostow’s model was to focused on savings. None of these models have been able to explain a lot of instances throughout history. Over the last 50 years quality of life has greatly increased. He points out the issues of each of the models to make the point economic models aren’t successful. 

	
**Question #4.  Who was Steve Jones? What did he do at uni-lever? Was he successful? How significant were his results?**

Steve Jones was someone who worked in soup powder. He made the nozzle part of that process work a lot more efficiently. He took the nozzle and made copies of it while distorting it. He took the ten most efficient models and made more copies of that taking the most successful ones. In the end people don’t know why it works a lot more efficiently, but it does. This illustrates adaptive change. He kept on adapting the model which resulted in the success he got in the end. The point is trial and error is necessary for success.  

**Question #5.  What is a complex adaptive system? What are some of its important features?**

Every successful complex system is the result of adaptation. A society and economy require a large number of different adaptive processes. All moving parts of the parts interact with one another while co-evolving. There’s a constant process of adapting in relation to many moving parts. That’s the basic idea of complex adaptive systems. Economists have tried to model growth linearly but its simply not a linear thing. Complex adaptive systems are impossible to predict exactly to the detail, but able to predict about the system as a whole. It also has emergent properties, meaning that some aspects don’t directly interact with another. It moves towards more complexity, and lastly it doesn’t move towards an equilibrium. 

**Question #6.  Who was Haile Sellasie?  According to Barder (and Kapuscinski), how did Ethiopia during the time of The Emporer exemplify the suppression of emergent systemic change?**

Kapuscinski chronicled the last days of Ethiopian emperor Haile Sellasie. In Ethiopia back then, it tried to extract economic value out of its citizens. It didn’t support the co-evolution of the country as a whole. The people in power tried to stay in power, and as a result development did not happen as only at the top was things improving. As a whole this does not lead to more development, and suppresses systematic change. 

**Question #7. Why does Barder recommend resisting engineering as a policy implication? What did he mean by iso-morphic mimicry?**

Engineering solution sis really difficult as specific improvements don’t necessarily lead to improvement. All parts of the system need to improve as a whole but what makes it so difficult is that it’s difficult to predict what will happen as a result of the changes we make. The idea of iso-morphic mimicry is that countries should not just copy what other countries have done. All countries cannot do organically the same thing. Things not to work in relation to another and all countries have different moving parts. A lot of the time the changes made results in something that looks like improvement but is not actually improving things. 

**Question #8.  What does Barder mean by "resist fatalism"? Who was Norman Borlaug and what is the green revolution?**

We don’t have to accept all the outcomes of evolution. Norman Borlaug interfered in the process of evolution and guided it in the way that he wanted. He did this for wheat by selecting disease resistant wheat varieties and prioritizing those parts. That’s essentially what countries should do to embitter development. As everything is co-evolving. Don’t just sit there and do nothing, but rather take the good parts and emphasize those so the direction of the evolution is positive. Choosing how we evolve our country is important.
