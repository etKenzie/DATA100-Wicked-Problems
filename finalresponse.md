**Using these Ideas from Aral, Georgescu-Roegen, and Geoff West as well as other sources from this semester (including your own personal insights and reflections),  how is the advent of data science serving to advance our understanding of complex adaptive, economic and social systems?**

Throughout this semester I’ve gotten a better understanding to the usefulness and power of Data. Simply from understanding data humans have the power to predict the future, make more sense of the world, and answer many inquiries we’ve made in the past. For example, human behaviour has a lot more patterns and commonalities than we might expect. From conducting experiments on how people react to certain scenarios and on animals to look deeper into our basic instincts we better understand ourselves. Pavlov’s dog is a prime showing of this as we see how simply by associating sounds to positive outcomes, dogs can be influenced simply from that stimulus. In the same way when humans get positive reinforcement from doing the same thing, they begin to want to repeat that behaviour more and more. Though this is a primitive example which was conducted a long time ago, data was still necessary to verify these outcomes. With data we become surer of our predictions and able to make more intricate conclusions. 

Aral’s quote of showing the importance of measurement actually hints at how vast data science is. There is not a single discipline that encompasses all data, but rather data in a part of so many aspects of our lives. From human behaviour to scientific experiments, everything uses data. This shows the importance of measurements. If we are able to more effectively measure and collect data, then the conclusions and insights we can obtain will grow. His quote looks at the idea that those two aspects are proportional in some way with the other, meaning a positive change in one leads to an increase in the other. 

Roagan’s insight about how economic systems are directly evolutionary systems says a lot about the nature of many systems based on data. They constantly change, alongside the development of data collection. Simply from improving how we can perceive economic systems, there will subsequently be a change in economic systems that accounts for that improvement. 

West’s quote proves even further how improvements in measurement means improvement in understanding. As shown before, with being able to better measure the world around us comes a better understanding of the world. This is because we are more able to confirm our ideas and draw better conclusions from the world around us. With more ways to measure the world comes more ways to test and destroy past theories. This is the idea of behind the falsification theory. Karl Popper, proposed the idea that for a theory to be considered scientific, there must be ways for it to be tested and proven false. An improvement in measurements allows more ways for past theories to be rendered invalid, hence strengthening the truths and conclusions that we make today. 

One very important use of data science is actually to make our lives more convenient. This is actually one aspect of it that I appreciate strongly, because of how strong of a direct impact it has on our lives. Companies collect data to strengthen their products. With better understandings of how their consumers behave based on past products they can more concretely create a better one. For example, think about computer hardware such as mice, keyboards, and even something we don’t directly touch to use such as graphic cards. With companies like Logitech creating mice and keyboards, they need data on the human anatomy and ergonomics to create the most comfortable and useful mice for their target consumers. This leads to different kinds of hardware for different people depending on what they want to use it for. Gamers need very accurate and fast mice, while programmers would need comfortable keyboards. From the data they collect they can adjust these products to more readily suit their target consumers. Even for something like the GPU shortage we have today, data allows companies to know when they need to make more. The current GPU shortage is partially due to inaccurate predictions of these companies in predicting how much GPU’s they needed to make, as demand for them have skyrocketed. With more accurate predictions shortages can possibly be better avoided. Of course, for this specific example COVID had a huge part to play but still for the future companies can learn to better predict how much product they need to create. 

Despite all these advantages not everything about data is positive. There are some people who misinterpret or become afraid of the predictions made by data. For example, when COVID initially started there were so many predictions of how long it was going to last based on models made by professionals. This is not inherently a bad thing, but it did cause a huge uproar in fear of needing more supplies, which caused many shortages in the supermarket even for something as random as toilet paper. This goes to show how data and predictions can scare people to take drastic action which harms others. But in my opinion these things are necessary as I would rather live in a world where I’m more informed even if I’m scared rather than one where I don’t know enough. 

Considering all these things, data still to this day is growing and evolving. There is so much ways in which we can use data that students from a young age is learning the basics to processing them in so many of their classes. In the end the most important lessons I take from this class is acknowledging the potential of data and being more aware of how I can use it. Though people’s interpretations of data are both good and bad, I still want to use data in ways that let me understand things I find important. Data is everywhere so we have to use it.
