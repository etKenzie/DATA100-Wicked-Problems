At this point I'm adding population data into my country. But I found that Zambia was too big a country to do this for as it had 161 million gridcells. So I switched countries to Jordan and created this initial plot of population density.

After that I extracted the populatiton count data then implemented that into my plot to show the different densities of different counties within Jordan to provide this plot.
