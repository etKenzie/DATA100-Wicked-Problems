## Starting

At this point I'm adding population data into my country. But I found that Zambia was too big a country to do this for as it had 161 million gridcells. So I switched countries to Jordan and created this initial plot of population density.

## ADM 1

After that I extracted the populatiton count data then implemented that into my plot to show the different densities of different counties within Jordan to provide this plot.

Same thing as before but with adm 2.
